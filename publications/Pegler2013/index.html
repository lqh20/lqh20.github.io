<p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of viscous gravity currents introduced at the surface of a denser inviscid fluid layer of finite depth inside a vertical Hele-Shaw cell. Initially, the viscous fluid floats on the inviscid fluid, forming a self-similar, buoyancy-driven current resisted predominantly by the viscous stresses due to shear across the width of the cell. Once the viscous current contacts the base of the cell, the flow can be considered in two regions: a grounded region in which the current lies in full contact with the base; and a floating region. The subsequent advance of the grounding line separating these regions is shown to be controlled by the thickening of the current associated with balancing the local shear stresses. An understanding of the flow transitions is developed using asymptotic and numerical analysis of a model based on lubrication theory.</p>
